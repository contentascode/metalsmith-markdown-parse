<p>Try visiting websites with similar content to your website. Also try using <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/gettor.html">Tor</a> or <a href="https://psiphon.ca/products.php">Psiphon</a> to access your site.
If you can visit your site via Tor or Psiphon, you have a <strong><em>censorship problem</em></strong> - you are still online for other parts of the world, but are being censored in your own country.</p>

<p>Would you like to do something about this censorship?</p>

<li><p><strong>Backups</strong> - In addition to the services and suggestions below, it’s always a good idea to make sure you have backups (that you store somewhere other than the same place your website is!). Many hosts and website platforms have this included, but it’s best to also have additional, offline copies.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Keep software up to date</strong> - If you are using a Content Management System (CMS) such as WordPress or Drupal, make sure that your website technology is updated to the latest software, especially if there have been security updates.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Monitoring</strong> - There are many services that can constantly check on your site and email or text you if it goes down. <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/04/09/free-uptime-monitoring/">This Mashable article</a> lists 10 popular ones. Be aware that the email or phone number you use for monitoring will be clearly associated with managing the website.</p>
