<li><p><strong>Document harassment:</strong> It is helpful to document the attacks or any other incident you may be witnessing: take screenshots, save the messages you receive from harassers, etc. If you feel overwhelmed, try to think of someone you trust who could document the incidents for you for a while. You should trust deeply the person who will manage this documentation, as you will need to hand them over credentials to your personal accounts. Once you feel you can regain control of their account, remember to change your passwords.</p>

<li><p><strong>Set up 2-factor authentication</strong> on all your accounts. 2-factor authentication can be very effective for stopping someone from accessing your accounts without your permission. If you can choose, don&#39;t use SMS-based 2-factor authentication and choose a different option, based on a phone app or on a security key.</p>
